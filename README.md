# react-business-app-boilerplate

This is a sample boilerplate for a multi domain business app, build for the @devscansados meetup, to demonstrate that React could be well used on a more complex situation, as well.

## Using this project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/luisgustavolf/react-business-app-boilerplate.git

# Install all decencies 
yarn 

# Play with it
yarn start

# Or, build it, and see the generated bundles
yarn build
```

## Good stuff

* A comprehensive app structure, focused on multi domain development
* Well suited for a one or two teams, working on it

## Please have in mind

* This is a sample project 
* There as a lot things missing, that will make all the difference in a dally basis using, like:
    * Better documentation 
    * CLI
    * Components patterns 
    * Service patterns 
    * Standard libraries (like antd, axios, ...)
    * Unit testing
    * ...


Hope it would be helpful, anyway :D
